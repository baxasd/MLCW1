# Machine Learning Coursework 1 (Z22590018_MLCW1)

Brief coursework repository for supervised machine learning experiments and analysis using the provided dataset and Jupyter notebook. Notebook uses Regression, Decision Tree and Random forest regressors to analyze data

## Contents
- [cw1data.csv](cw1data.csv) — CSV dataset used in the notebook.
- [Z22590018_MLCW1.ipynb](Z22590018_MLCW1.ipynb) — Primary Jupyter notebook with code, experiments, and results.
- [.gitignore](.gitignore) — Git ignore rules (excludes notebook checkpoints).
- .ipynb_checkpoints/ — Automatic Jupyter checkpoint files (ignored by git).

## Quick start
1. Open the notebook in VS Code or Jupyter:
   - VS Code: open [Z22590018_MLCW1.ipynb](Z22590018_MLCW1.ipynb) in the editor.
   - Jupyter: run `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook` from the repository root and open the notebook.
2. Ensure you have the usual data-science packages installed (e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
3. Run the notebook cells in order to reproduce preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualizations.

## Notes
- The dataset is stored in [cw1data.csv](cw1data.csv). Keep the file in the repository root when running the notebook.
- Checkpoints produced by Jupyter live in `.ipynb_checkpoints/` and are excluded by [.gitignore](.gitignore).
